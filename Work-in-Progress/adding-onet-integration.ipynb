We'll use a clear delimiter to indicate that the model should generate the output in the specified JSON format.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Set Up the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install langchain openai\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Initialize the OpenAI API\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up your OpenAI API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",

    "#### Step 3: Define Functions with Clear JSON Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the functions to produce JSON output with a clear indication that the format is part of the response, not additional variables.\n",

    "#### Step 6: Use the Agent to Generate the Structured Response\n",
